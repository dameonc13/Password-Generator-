# Password-Generator-

In this repository I  write a password generator website using html css and javascript. This code takes in user input and then randomize all the characters selected and write to the document. 

When page load it will ask the user for their preferences and for the user to see the password they would have to click the button generate password. The user can also copy to clipboard by 

clicking the button copy.
