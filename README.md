# Questions
In this repository I  write a password generator website using html css and javascript. This code takes in user input and then randomize all the characters selected and write to the document. 

When page load several prompts will appear asking the user for certain preferences. The user will be first asked to submit the length of the password with limitations such as 

password cannot be shorter than 8 characters and will not move on unless the requirement is met. The user will also asked for what characters they want in their password such as 

numbers, special characters, capitalized and lowercase numbers.

# Generator 
 For the user to see the password they would have to click the button generate password. The user can also copy to clipboard by  clicking the button copy. The user can click on the 

 generate button to get a different password with set preferences defied in the prompts. To change preferences the user will have to reload the page to and go through prompts again.

 This app isn't perfect it get the basic done further development will be done. 
 
 Noticeable bugs - When asked for length of password user can type in letters to bypass this. 
                - User can also bypass character preferences without saying yes to any. User should be required to provide yes to one before exiting questions.
